defmodule Alloy.Middleware do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for middleware that wraps the agent loop.

  Middleware runs at defined hook points:
  - `:before_completion` - Prepare request inputs before the provider call; list preparation before compaction
  - `:after_completion` - Finalize a normal answer or successful `:stop_after_tool` completion
  - `:after_compaction` - After context compaction occurs (only fires when messages changed)
  - `:after_tool_request` - After provider response with :tool_use (gates tool execution)
  - `:after_tool_execution` - After tools have been executed
  - `:before_tool_call` - Compose argument edits and policy checks before execution
  - `:after_tool_call` - Replace each result's content/data before publication
  - `:on_context_overflow` - Shrink messages after the provider rejects the context; retry once
  - `:on_error` - When an error occurs
  - `:session_start`, `:session_end` - Not fired by the loop; reserved for
    runtimes such as `alloy_agent` that wrap it in a process

  Middleware runs in list order and should return the state unchanged for
  hooks it does not handle (`def call(_hook, state), do: state`), since
  new hooks may be added.

  ## Compaction

  `Alloy.Context.Compactor` is middleware: it compacts on
  `:before_completion` when the history nears the context budget, and
  forces compaction on `:on_context_overflow`. `Alloy.run/2` puts it last
  so it budgets the prepared inputs, unless you pass `compaction: false`
  or list it yourself to choose its position.

  Called at the specified hook point. Returns modified state,

  A halted run keeps the changes earlier middleware made to the state in
  that hook (for example, compaction and the usage of its summary
  request). Return `{:halt, reason, state}` to halt with changes of your
  own. `:before_tool_call` is the exception: it decides about one tool
  call and never changes the loop's state, so a halt there keeps the
  state as it was before the hook.
